# Summary

:::info
This book explains JavaScript from the bottom up. 

This means that we start with low-level details like comments, identifiers, variables, and types; then build to expressions, statements, objects, and functions; and then cover high-level language abstractions like classes and modules. 

I take the word definitive in the title of this book seriously, and the coming chapters explain the language at a level of detail that may feel off-putting at first. 

True mastery of JavaScript requires an understanding of the details, however, and I hope that you will make time to read this book cover to cover. 

But please don’t feel that you need to do that on your first reading. 

If you find yourself feeling bogged down in a section, simply skip to the next. 

You can come back and master the details once you have a working knowledge of the language as a whole.

本书以自底向上的方式解释 JavaScript。

这意味着要先从较低层次的注释、标识符、变量和类型讲起，然后在此基础上介绍表达式、语句、对象和函数。接着介绍更高层次的语言抽象，例如类和模块。

本书的书名包含“权威”二字是认真的，接下来的章节对这门语言的解释可能详细得令人反感。

然而，想要真正掌握 JavaScript 必须理解这些细节，希望你能花时间从头到尾读完这本书。

不过，不要一上来就想着这样做。假如某一节内容你怎么也看不懂，可以先跳过去。

等你对这门语言有了一个整体的了解时，可以再回来了解那些细节。
