JavaScript is the programming language of the web. 

The overwhelming majority of websites use JavaScript, and all modern web browsers — on desktops, tablets, and phones — include JavaScript interpreters, making JavaScript the most-deployed programming language in history. 

Over the last decade, Node.js has enabled JavaScript programming outside of web browsers, and the dramatic success of Node means that JavaScript is now also the most-used programming language among software developers. 

Whether you're starting from scratch or are already using JavaScript professionally, this book will help you master the language.

JavaScript 是 Web 编程语言。绝大多数网站都使用 JavaScript，所有现代 Web 浏览器（无论是桌面、平板还是手机浏览器，书中以后统称为浏览器）都包含 JavaScript 解释器，这让 JavaScript 成为有史以来部署最广泛的编程语言。过去十年，Node.js 让浏览器之外 JavaScript 编程成为可能，Node的巨大成功意味着 JavaScript 如今也是软件开发者最常用的编程语言。无论你是从头开始，还是已经在工作中使用 JavaScript，本书都能帮你掌握这门语言。

If you are already familiar with other programming languages, it may help you to know that JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, interpreted programming language that is well-suited to object-oriented and functional programming styles. 

JavaScript's variables are untyped. Its syntax is loosely based on Java, but the languages are otherwise unrelated. 

JavaScript derives its first-class functions from Scheme and its prototype-based inheritance from the little-known language Self. 

But you do not need to know any of those languages, or be familiar with those terms, to use this book and learn JavaScript.

如果你已经熟悉其他编程语言，那有必要知道JavaScript是一门高级、动态、解释型编程语言，非常适合面向对象和函数式编程风格。JavaScript 的变量是无类型的，它的语法大致与 Java 相仿，但除此之外这两门语言之间没有任何关系。JavaScript 从 Scheme 借鉴了一类（first class）函数，从不太知名的 Self 借鉴了基于原型的继承。但要阅读本书或学习 JavaScript 不需要了解这些语言，也不必熟悉这些术语。

The name "JavaScript" is quite misleading. Except for a superficial syntactic resemblance, JavaScript is completely different from the Java programming language. 

And JavaScript has long since outgrown its scripting-language roots to become a robust and efficient general-purpose language suitable for serious software engineering and projects with huge codebases.

JavaScript 这个名字相当有误导性。除了表面上语法相似，它与 Java 是完全不同的两门编程语言。JavaScript 经历了很长时间才从一门脚本语言成长为一门健壮高效的通用语言，适合开发代码量巨大的重要软件工程和项目。
