# A Short History

:::info
As the web gained popularity, a gradual demand for client-side scripting languages developed. 

At the time, most Internet users were connecting over a 28.8 kbps modem even though web pages were growing in size and complexity. 

Adding to users'pain was the large number of round-trips to the server required for simple form validation. 

Imagine filling out a form, clicking the Submit button, waiting 30 seconds for processing, and then being met with a message indicating that you forgot to complete a required field. 

Netscape, at that time on the cutting edge of technological innovation, began seriously considering the development of a client-side scripting language to handle simple processing.

随着 Web 日益流行，对客户端脚本语言的需求也越来越强烈。

当时，大多数用户使用 28.8kbit/s 的调制解调器上网，但网页变得越来越大、越来越复杂。

为验证简单的表单而需要大量与服务器的往返通信成为用户的痛点。

想象一下，你填写完表单，单击“提交”按钮，等 30 秒处理，然后看到一条消息，告诉你有一个必填字段没填。

网景在当时是引领技术革新的公司，它将开发一个客户端脚本语言来处理这种简单的数据验证提上了日程。
