When JavaScript first appeared in 1995, its main purpose was to handle some of the input validation that had previously been left to server-side languages such as Perl. 

Prior to that time, a round-trip to the server was needed to determine if a required field had been left blank or an entered value was invalid. 

Netscape Navigator sought to change that with the introduction of JavaScript. 

The capability to handle some basic validation on the client was an exciting new feature at a time when use of telephone modems was widespread. 

The associated slow speeds turned every trip to the server into an exercise in patience.

1995 年，JavaScript 问世。当时，它的主要用途是代替 Perl 等服务器端语言处理输入验证。在此之前，要验证某个必填字段是否已填写，或者某个输入的值是否有效，需要与服务器的一次往返通信。网景公司希望通过在其 Navigator 浏览器中加入 JavaScript 来改变这个局面。在那个普遍通过电话拨号上网的年代，由客户端处理某些基本的验证是让人兴奋的新功能。缓慢的网速让页面每次刷新都考验着人们的耐心。

Since that time, JavaScript has grown into an important feature of every major web browser on the market. 

No longer bound to simple data validation, JavaScript now interacts with nearly all aspects of the browser window and its contents. 

JavaScript is recognized as a full programming language, capable of complex calculations and interactions, including closures, anonymous (lambda) functions, and even metaprogramming. 

JavaScript has become such an important part of the web that even alternative browsers, including those on mobile phones and those designed for users with disabilities, support it. 

Even Microsoft, with its own client-side scripting language called VBScript, ended up including its own JavaScript implementation in Internet Explorer from its earliest version.

从那时起，JavaScript 逐渐成为市面上所有主流浏览器的标配。如今，JavaScript 的应用也不再局限于数据验证，而是渗透到浏览器窗口及其内容的方方面面。JavaScript 已被公认为主流的编程语言，能够实现复杂的计算与交互，包括闭包、匿名（lambda）函数，甚至元编程等特性。不仅是桌面浏览器，手机浏览器和屏幕阅读器也支持 JavaScript，其重要性可见一斑。就连拥有自家客户端脚本语言 VBScript 的微软公司，也在其 Internet Explorer（以下简称 IE）浏览器最初的版本中包含了自己的 JavaScript 实现。

The rise of JavaScript from a simple input validator to a powerful programming language could not have been predicted.

JavaScript is at once a very simple and very complicated language that takes minutes to learn but years to master.

To begin down the path to using JavaScript's full potential, it is important to understand its nature, history, and limitations.

从简单的输入验证脚本到强大的编程语言，JavaScript 的崛起没有任何人预测到。它很简单，学会用只要几分钟；它又很复杂，掌握它要很多年。要真正学好用好 JavaScript，理解其本质、历史及局限性是非常重要的。
